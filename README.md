# EXIOBASE-v3.4
Here I share a series of codes I have written to process EXIOBASE v3.4. Every code will have a short description at the beginning and how it can be used. 

This repository intends to help Industrial Ecologists interested in Environmentally Input-Output Analysis fast their calculations and dive into more complex analyses. Recommendations and collaborations are welcomed.

In the coming months, I will add some codes I am writing to merge SUTs from Canada, USA and Mexico (NAFTA signatory countries) and link these to EXIOBASE. 

This work intends to help me to publish some articles in my "academic" and professional life.
